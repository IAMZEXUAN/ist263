        Zexuan Li 

        I am currently a junior in SU. My hometown is Shanghai, China and this is my seventh year studying in the US. 
        
        I am an Advertising major interested in media/communication planning in the Ad business. 
        
        Although I struggled at the beginning of high school, I was able to pick myself up and bounce back as a first honor student at the end of high school (guess I am pretty resilient then).  
        
        I am an avid gamer. I enjoy skiing. One of my favorite movie of all time would be Inception.  
        
        Looking forward to learning all about web design!!
