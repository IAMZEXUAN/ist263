        <h1>Zexuan Li's Biography</h1>
        
        <p>
            I am currently a junior in SU. My hometown is Shanghai, China and this is my seventh year studying in the US.
            I am an <strong>Advertising major</strong> interested in media/communication planning in the Ad business.

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
            Although I struggled at the beginning of high school, I was able to pick myself up and bounce back as a first honor student at the end of high school (guess I am pretty resilient then).
