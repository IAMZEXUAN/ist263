            <h3>Fun facts</h3>
            <p>
                The silver arowana inhabits the basins of South America such as the Amazon and Essequibo. It has an elongated body covered with large silver scales, which imply the name of the fish. Unlike the asian arowana, silver arowana’s dorsal and anal fins extend all the way back to its tiny caudal fin. And it is also the longer arowana fish, for it can grow up to 3 ft in an aquarium, but it can get even bigger in its natural habitat. Silver arowana, like the asian arowana, is sometimes referred to as the “dragon fish”, for it has a pair barbels in front of its mouth, which resemble the depiction of a chinese dragon.
                Fun fact: The silver arowana is known for its ability to jump out of the water and prey on insects that hang from tree branches near the surface, which gave it the nickname “water monkey”. For fish keepers, this is something everyone should look out for. Since these fish have a tendency to jump, it is important to keep them in a lidded tank with suitable setups for their safety and well being.

            <h3>Things to look out for</h3>
            <p>
                Tank size: A fully mature silver arowana requires at least 250 gallons of water to thrive.
                Because they tend to live for 10-15 years under proper care, and juveniles grow up extremely fast (around 2 inches a month), it is better to keep them in a large tank to begin with, so they won’t feel stressed out or have development issues when they grow up, and you can also avoid the trouble of switching them to a bigger tank.
            </p><br>
            <P>
                Water: One important factor for fish health is the water parameters. Normally, fish do better in water that mimics their natural habitats.
                Here are the specific requirements for the water:
                PH level: 5 to 7.5. Keep it around 6.5 for the best result, arowana love water that is slightly acidic.
                Hardness of water: 1 to 8 dKH. Arowana aren’t too picky when it comes to water hardness, so do focus more on the PH level and temperature.
                Temperature: 75°F to 82°F. Be sure to prepare a heater in case of cold winters.
                Others: Be sure to eliminate chemicals like Ammonia and Nitrites, for they are toxic to any fish in the aquarium, and keep Nitrates below 40 ppm. In order to do that, you should definitely keep up with regular water changes (25% per week).
            </P><br>
            <p>
                Lighting: For silver arowana, you will only need typical viewing lights that matches the size of you tank.
            </p><br>
            <p> 
                Feeding your fish: Since arowana are carnivorous fish, their diet should mainly be protein based. Shrimps, crickets, and small fish can be great options. They can take both live and frozen food, but make sure what they eat is unspoiled, especially for frozen food. As juveniles, arowana need to be fed twice a day for rapid and healthy growth, and make sure their food isn’t too big to swallow. When they reach adulthood, you can cut it down to once a day. When they are full, they will normally stop feeding on what you give them, so do pay attention and clean up anything that’s left uneaten.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Community: If you intend to add other fish to your aquarium with the silver arowana, there are a few things to pay attention to.
                Don’t add any non-feeder fish that the arowana can swallow, it will end up as bite-sized snacks for the arowana.
                The fish you add should be be sizable fish that are generally docile. They should be big enough so the arowana can’t eat them, but they should also be docile enough to not bully the arowana.
                The size of your community depends on the size of your tank. If your tank is big enough, then more fish can be added without them constantly competing for territory and space. 
                Some common community fish for arowana include: Stingrays, bichirs, large catfish, etc.
