                <h3>Fun facts</h3>
                <p>
                    The asian arowana originates from the swamps and wetlands of Southeast Asia. They are mainly differentiated by their colorization, which is also what they are valued for. Specifically, the Red Tail Golden Arowana, the Golden Crossback Arowana, and the Red Arowana are some of the more iconic ones among Asian Arowana. They don’t grow as long as the silver arowana, but they can still reach 35 inches. While having elongated pectoral fins, their dorsal and anal fins are much shorter and wider, and their caudal fin is much bigger than the silver arowana.
                    *Due to them being listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act, it is illegal purchase or sell Asian Arowana in the US.

                <h3>Things to look out for</h3>
                <p>
                    Tank size: Any type of asian arowana requires at least a 120 gallons tank.
                    Asian arowana can live up to 60 years in proper care, so it is crucial to keep them in a large and sturdy tank for their health. Although they don’t need as much space as silver arowana, they still tend to do better in bigger volumes of water.  Also, make sure that the tank is wide enough for the fish to turn properly. Asian arowana’s body is relatively thicker, and they will have trouble turning in a narrow aquarium. To solve this, you should aim for a tank that is at least 2 feet wide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Water: The water parameters for keeping any arowana are typically universal.
                    Here are the specific requirements for the water:
                    PH level: 5 to 7.5. 6.5 is an ideal ph level for asian arowana.
                    Hardness of water: 1 to 8 dKH.
                    Temperature: 75°F to 82°F. Arowana are tropical fish, so make sure to prepare a heater for colder days.
                    Others: Be sure to eliminate chemicals like Ammonia and Nitrites, for they are toxic to any fish in the aquarium, and keep Nitrates below 40 ppm. A powerful filtration system and regular water changes (25% per week) can help you keep those chemicals at a minimum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lighting: Like all other species of arowana (or any aquarium fish), viewing light is a must have. But for asian arowana, tanning lights are also commonly used to bring out the rich colors of asian arowana, especially gold and red arowana. While the topic of whether tanning lights should be used or not is still debatable, since tanning lights can actually harm the fish if used improperly, it is still acknowledged that tanning lights do help with enhancing the fish’s colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feeding your fish: Asian arowana’s diet consists mainly of high protein food such as small fish, shrimps, and insects. When they are little, they need to be fed more often. Specifically, you should feed them twice a day when they are juveniles and once a day when they are adults. Be sure to mix up the types of food you are feeding them, so their meals are more balanced, which helps with maintaining their health. While some hobbyists might feed their asian arowana color enhancing food such as pellets and food sticks, they are typically resistant when it comes to taking processed food, so the typical high protein diet should still be your number one choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Community: Unlike their South American siblings, asian arowana are known to be more territorial, and two asian arowana might also fight for dominance if they are kept in the same tank. While it is still possible to mix them up with other fish of the same size, it is better to just keep one asian arowana per tank. And if you insist on keeping other fish in the same tank, you would want to minimize conflict by keeping fish that stays out of the asian arowana’s territory. Since asian arowana mainly dwells at the surface, bottom dwelling fish are going to be better tank mates than most.
